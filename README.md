## Welcome to QFG5Patcher :)

Important note to start with: If you own QFG5 in a language different than English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Russian, please get in touch with me! I would like to add as many languages as possible to the patcher :)

Hello everyone! :)

Since 2017, I've put my knowledge into contribution and developed this tool for the **Quest for Glory 5**'s community
This tools keeps growing and currently allows to :

1. **Patch the game's texts/subtitles into 6 currently supported languages:**
    - **French**
    - **English**
    - **Spanish** (translated by microweb with the help of Chyron. Thank you very much guys for your incredible contribution to QFG5 community! Your work is absolutely amazing! :)
    - **Portuguese**
    - **German**
    - **Russian**
2. **Contains a crash fix that was only affecting french and russian versions of the game. The crash was occurring in the 5 villages' chest room, making it nearly impossible to progress.**
3. **Fixes ALL known crashes & animation sequence getting stuck when playing as Elsa and Magnum. This should make possible an entire walkthrough as Elsa and Magnum.**
4. **Fixes a crash that was happening under obscure circumstances whenever triggering an inland random encounter. This crash was very serious because it affected the savegame. This also fixes cases where a random encounter sound would play without launching any fight**
5. **Fixes the dragonlings sound crash occuring when performing the 'fire breathing' attack. This should also fix the dragon crash.**
6. **Fixes random crash occurring when using Thermonuclear spell in a relatively densely populated area (such as the invaded villages)**
7. **Fixes 'Glide' spell crash due to missing graphics (spell was cut from the game, but it is still accessible using a savegame editor)**
8. **Improve compatibity on newer Operating Systems (mostly relevant if you own a CD version of the game)**
9. **Customize your experience** :
    - [General options]
        - Lets you choose between 3 characters to start your adventure with.
        - Lets you set the amount of money in bank when starting a new adventure.
        - Change the Mystic Magnet's teleport destination.
        - Unlock exclusive weapons cut from the game.
        - Polygamy mode (lets you buy as many Hera's ring as you want).
        - Lets you re-enable basic QFG5's original debug info
        - Lets you play the game without the need of a CD (no-cd, option only relevant if you play the CD version of the game)
    - [Character customization's options]
        - Lets you set the amount of attributable skill points
        - Lets you set the cost for learning a new skill
        - Lets you set the cost for improving a known skill
        - Lets you set the skills' maximum attributable points
        - Lets you choose whether or not you want to prevent the game from altering characters' stats at import (to make 'Collection Challenge Mode' possible in QFG5)
        - Lets you define the characters' base skills values for each of the classes (Fighter, Wizard, Thief and Paladin)
    - Many more features to come...
10. **Crash detection with knowledge base**
    When the game is launched through QFG5Patcher: the tool will automatically detect your game's crashes.
    - If a solution for it is found offline, it's going to give you some instructions on how to fix it.
    - If a solution for it is found online, you will be offered to be redirected to the url containing all the information about the issue, and how to fix it.

This tool is fully functional with the game purchased from any support (CD, Steam, GOG).
