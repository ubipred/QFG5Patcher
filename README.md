Hello everyone! :)

Since 2017, I've put my knowledge into contribution and developed this tool for the **Quest for Glory 5**'s community
This tools keeps growing and currently allows to :

1. **Patch the game's texts/subtitles into 6 currently supported languages:**
    - **French**
    - **English**
    - **Spanish** (translated by microweb with the help of Chyron. Thank you very much guys for your incredible contribution to QFG5 community! Your work is absolutely amazing! :)
    - **Portuguese**
    - **German**
    - **Russian**
2. **Contains a crash fix that was only affecting french and russian versions of the game. The crash was occurring in the 5 villages' chest room, making it nearly impossible to progress.**
3. **Improve compatibity on newer Operating Systems (mostly relevant if you own a CD version of the game)**
4. **Customize your experience** :
    - Lets you choose between 3 characters to start your adventure with.
    - Lets you set the amount of money in bank when starting a new adventure.
    - Lets you set the amount of skill points to assign during character creations.
    - Change the Mystic Magnet's teleport destination.
    - Unlock exclusive weapons cut from the game.
    - Polygamy mode (lets you buy as many Hera's ring as you want).
    - Many more features to come...
5. **Crash detection with knowledge base**
    When the game is launched through QFG5Patcher: the tool will automatically detect your game's crashes.
    - If a solution for it is found offline, it's going to give you some instructions on how to fix it.
    - If a solution for it is found online, you will be offered to be redirected to the url containing all the information about the issue, and how to fix it.

This tool is fully functional with the game purchased from any support (CD, Steam, GOG).
